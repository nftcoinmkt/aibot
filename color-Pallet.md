Tip: A website or app should have one cohesive color scheme with up to four core colors. Using too many colors can make the interface look cluttered[1].





2. Applying the Colors
Dominant, Secondary and Accent
Following the classic 60‑30‑10 rule helps balance the palette.
 Use 60 % of a light neutral (e.g., #CAF0F8 or #ADE8F4) as the primary background, 30 % of a stronger blue (e.g., #023E8A or #0077B6) for major UI elements (headers, buttons, navigation), and 10 % of an accent color (e.g., #00B4D8) for call‑to‑action buttons or highlights[1].
Backgrounds
·       Default backgrounds should be light to improve readability and create an inviting feel[2]. Off‑white (#CAF0F8) or very light blue (#ADE8F4) are ideal for page backgrounds and chat panes.
·       For dark mode (if implemented later), use the dark navy (#03045E) sparingly with sufficient contrast.
Text and Contrast
·       Maintain high contrast between text and backgrounds so messages remain easy to read. This improves accessibility and reduces eye strain[3].
·       When using light backgrounds, dark blue (#023E8A) or black for text offers good legibility. Avoid using vibrant accent colors for large text blocks.
Buttons and Interactive Elements
·       Primary buttons and CTAs should use the mid‑blue (#0077B6) or bright turquoise (#0096C7).
·       Accent actions (e.g., a floating “New Group” button) can use the bright accent #00B4D8 to stand out.
·       Secondary buttons or input borders can use the softer #48CAE4 for a subdued look.




Chat Bubbles and Cards
·       Sender and receiver messages should be visually distinct. For example, use #90E0EF for the user’s messages and #CAF0F8 or white for other participants; differentiate with subtle border radius and alignment[4].
·       Include small elements like timestamps in muted colors so they don’t distract[5].
Minimalism and Simplicity
·       Keep screens uncluttered and avoid excessive decorations or distracting elements; a minimalist approach helps users focus on the conversation[6].
·       Limit additional colors outside the palette. If needed, derive new shades by adding transparency or mixing existing palette colors to maintain harmony.
Accessibility Considerations
·       Ensure color pairs meet contrast ratio standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) for users with low vision.
·       Provide enough whitespace and padding around elements to reduce cognitive load.
3. Example Use Cases
·       Navigation bar: deep blue (#023E8A) with white or light blue icons.
·       Chat input: border or background in #ADE8F4 with send button in #0077B6.
·       Summary messages/system messages: place them in muted, pastel backgrounds like #ADE8F4 to differentiate them from regular chat while maintaining the palette[7].
By following these guidelines and the color codes above, the app will maintain a consistent and professional look while remaining accessible and easy to navigate.
